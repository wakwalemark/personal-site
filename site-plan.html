      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>WINE RESERVE LIQOUR Store is a locally established retail liquor store located in kabalagala kampala uganda.

        The store is founded by DRAKU HENRY a retired United States Marine who has recently retired from his service and will use his career savings to open up a liquor store in his hometown of KAMPALA. HENRY has been educated on all kinds of beer, wine, and liquor during his years of living overseas and all over the country. He has become passionate about his wealth of alcohol knowledge and wants to make owning and operating a liquor store his second career.
        
        WINE RESERVE LIQOUR Store will carry spirits, beer, and wine to suit all budgets. We will have a wide selection of premium and standard liquor, craft and domestic beer, and a large assortment of red wine, white wine, sparkling wine, rose/blush wine, and champagne. Pricing will be on par with competitors and we will run monthly and weekly specials on select alcohol. Highball Liquor Store will also offer a membership club for frequent visitors to redeem points for discounted items.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Given a 2012 Gallup poll indicating that most youths surveyed described themselves as regular drinkers, marketers of beer, wine and liquor have a lot of targets. However, alcohol preferences and consumption habits differ based on a number of factors. Age, gender, geography and leisure habits all influence drinking behavior, and businesses may find their largest target markets are heavily influenced by what alcohol they are trying to sell.</p>  <!-- change this -->
